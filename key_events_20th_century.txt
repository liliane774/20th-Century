The20th centurychanged the world in unprecedented ways. TheWorld Warssparked tension between countries and led to the creation ofatomic bombs, theCold Warled to theSpace Raceand the creation of space-based rockets, and theWorld Wide Webwas created. These advancements have played a significant role in citizens' lives and shaped the21st centuryinto what it is today.

The new beginning of the 20th century marked significant changes. The 1900s saw the decade herald a series of inventions, including theautomobile,airplaneandradio broadcasting. 1914 saw the completion of thePanama Canal.

TheScramble for Africacontinued in the 1900s and resulted in wars and genocide across the continent. Theatrocities in the Congo Free Stateshocked the civilized world.

From 1914 to 1918, the First World War, and its aftermath, caused major changes in the power balance of the world, destroying or transforming some of the most powerful empires.

The First World War (or simply WWI), termed "The Great War" by contemporaries, started in July 1914 and ended in November 1918. The war was precipitated by theAssassination in Sarajevoof theAustro-Hungarian Empire's heir to the throne, ErzherzogFranz Ferdinand, byGavrilo Princip, a member of theYoung Bosnialiberation movement. After a period of diplomatic and military escalation known as theJuly Crisis, by the end of July 1914 two coalitions were at war: the Allies, comprised initially of theBritish Empire,France, and theRussian Empire; and theCentral Powers, comprised initially of theGerman EmpireandAustria-Hungary.[1][2]

In 1917, Russia ended hostile actions against the Central Powers after the fall of the Tsar. The Bolsheviks negotiated theTreaty of Brest-Litovskwith Germany, although it was a huge cost to Russia. In the treaty, Bolshevik Russia ceded theBaltic statesto Germany, and its province ofKars Oblastin theSouth Caucasusto theOttoman Empire. It also recognized the independence ofUkraine.[3]Although Germany shifted huge forces from the eastern to the western front after signing the treaty, it was unable to stop the Allied advance, especially with the entrance of American troops in 1918.[4]

The war itself was also a chance for the combatant nations to show off their military strength and technological ingenuity. The Germans introduced the machine gun,[5]U-boats[6]and deadly gases.[7]The British first used thetank.[8]Both sides had a chance to test out their new aircraft to see if they could be used in warfare. It was widely believed that the war would be short. Unfortunately, sincetrench warfarewas the best form of defense, advances on both sides were very slow and came at a terrible cost to lives.[9]

When the war was finally over in 1918, the results would set the stage for the next twenty years. First and foremost, the Germans were forced to sign theTreaty of Versailles, forcing them to make exorbitant payments to repair damages caused during the War. Many Germans felt these reparations were unfair because they did not actually "lose" the war nor did they feel they caused the war (seeStab-in-the-back legend).[10]Germany was never occupied by Allied troops, yet it had to accept a liberal democratic government imposed on it by the victors after the abdication ofKaiser Wilhelm.[11]

Much of the map of Europe was redrawn by the victors based upon the theory that future wars could be prevented if all ethnic groups had their own "homeland".  New states likeYugoslaviaandCzechoslovakiawere created out of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire to accommodate the nationalist aspirations of these groups.[12]An international body called theLeague of Nationswas formed to mediate disputes and prevent future wars, although its effectiveness was severely limited by, among other things, its reluctance and inability to act.[13]

From 1918 to 1920, a remarkably deadly worldwide pandemiccaused by the flubroke out near the end of the war and spread globally. Estimates range from anywhere between 17 and 100 million deaths,[14][15][16]which staples it as thedeadliest pandemic in human history. One of the reasons for the exceptionally high carnage was that wartimecensorshipwas underway to preserve morale in the trenches, leading to poor hygiene. Combined with already existingmalnourishmentand overcrowded medical facilities, this mix made it all the more deadly.[17][18]

The Russian Revolution of 1917 (ending in the overthrow of the Tsarist regime and the execution of His Imperial MajestyNicholas IIand his family) sparked a wave ofcommunist revolutionsacross Europe, prompting many to believe that a socialistworld revolutioncould be realized in the near future.[19]However, the European revolutions were defeated,Vladimir Lenindied in 1924, and within a few years,Joseph StalindisplacedLeon Trotskyas thede factoleader of theSoviet Union. The idea of worldwide revolution was no longer in the forefront, as Stalin concentrated on "socialism in one country"[20]and embarked on a bold plan of collectivization and industrialization.[21]The majority of socialists and even many communists became disillusioned with Stalin's autocratic rule, his purges and the assassination of his "enemies", as well as the news offamineshe imposed on his own people.[22]

Communism was strengthened as a force in Western democracies when the global economy crashed in 1929 in what became known as theGreat Depression. Many people saw this as the first stage of the end of the capitalist system and were attracted to Communism as a solution to the economic crisis, especially as the Soviet Union's economic development in the 1930s was strong, unaffected by the capitalist world's crisis.[23]

After World War I, the global economyremained strongthrough most of the 1920s. The war had provided a stimulus for industry and economic activity in general. There were many warning signs foretelling thecrash of 29of the globaleconomic systemat the end of the decade, that were generally not understood by the political leadership of the time.[24]The responses to the crisis often made the situation worse, as millions of people watched their savings become next to worthless, and the idea of a steady job with a reasonable income fading away.[25]

Many sought answers from alternative ideologies such as communism and fascism.[26]They believed that the capitalist economic system was collapsing and that new ideas were required to meet the crisis. The early responses to the crisis were based on the assumption that the free market would correct itself. This, however, did very little to correct the crisis or to alleviate the suffering of many ordinary people. Thus, the idea that the existing system could be reformed by government intervention in the economy, rather than by continuing thelaissez-faireapproach, became prominent as a solution to the crisis. Democratic governments assumed the responsibility to provide needed services in society, and to alleviate poverty, which soon gave birth to thewelfare state.[27]These two politico-economic principles, the belief in government intervention and the welfare state, as opposed to the belief in the free market and private institutions, would define many political battles for the rest of the century.

Fascism first appeared in Italy with the rise to power ofBenito Mussoliniin 1922.[28]The ideology was supported by a large proportion of the upper classes as a strong challenge to the threat of communism.[29]

WhenAdolf Hitlercame to power in Germany in 1933, a new variant of fascism calledNazismtook over Germany and ended the German experiment with democracy. TheNazi Partyin Germany was dedicated to the restoration of German honor and prestige, the unification of German-speaking peoples, and the annexation of Central and Eastern Europe as vassal states, with theSlavicpopulation to act as slave labor to serve German economic interests.[30]There was also a strong appeal to a mythical racial purity (the idea that Germans were theHerrenvolkor the "master race"), and a viciousantisemitismwhich promoted the idea of Jews as subhuman (Untermensch) and worthy only of extermination.[31]

Many people in Western Europe and the United States greeted the rise of Hitler with relief or indifference.[32]They could see nothing wrong with a strong Germany ready to take on the communist menace to the east. Antisemitism during theGreat Depressionwas widespread as many were content to blame the Jews for causing the economic downturn.[33]

Hitler began to put his plan in motion, annexing Austria in theAnschluss, or reunification of Austria to Germany, in 1938.[34]He then negotiated the annexation of theSudetenland, a German-speaking mountainous area ofCzechoslovakia, in theMunich Conference.[35]The British were eager to avoid war and believed Hitler's assurance to protect the security of the Czech state.  Hitler annexed the rest of the Czech state shortly afterwards, indicating that he had ulterior motives.[36]

Fascism was not the only form of dictatorship to rise in the post-war period.  Almost all of the new democracies in the nations of Eastern Europe collapsed and were replaced byauthoritarianregimes.[37]Spain also became a dictatorship under the leadership of GeneralFrancisco Francoafter theSpanish Civil War.[38]Totalitarian states attempted to achieve total control over their subjects as well as their total loyalty. They held the state above the individual, and were often responsible for some of the worst acts in history, such as theHolocaustAdolf Hitler perpetrated onEuropean Jews, or theGreat PurgeStalin perpetrated in theSoviet Unionin the 1930s.

This section provides a conversational overview of World War II in Europe. See main article for a fuller discussion.

Soon after the events in Czechoslovakia, Britain and France issued assurances of protection to Poland, which seemed to be next on Hitler's list. World War II officially began on 1 September 1939, when Hitler unleashed hisBlitzkrieg, or lightning war, against Poland. Britain and France, much to Hitler's surprise, immediately declared war upon Germany, but the help they delivered to Poland was negligible.[39]Sixteen days later, Poland was attacked from the East by Soviet Union, acting in a secret alliance with Nazi Germany.[40]After only a few weeks, the Polish forces were overwhelmed, and its government fled to exile in London (seePolish government in Exile).

In starting World War II, the Germans had unleashed a new type of warfare, characterized by highly mobile forces and the use of massed aircraft. The German strategy concentrated upon the devotion of theWehrmacht, or German army, to the use of tank groups, calledpanzerdivisions, and groups of mobile infantry, in concert with relentless attacks from the air. Encirclement was also a major part of the strategy. This change smashed any expectations that the Second World War would be fought in the trenches like the first.[41]

As Hitler's forces conquered Poland, theSoviet Union, under General SecretaryJoseph Stalin, was acting out guarantees of territory under a secret part of anonaggression pactbetween the USSR and Germany known as theMolotov–Ribbentrop Pact. This treaty gave Stalin free rein to take the Baltic republics ofEstonia, Latvia, andLithuania, as well as Eastern Poland, all of which would remain in Soviet possession after the war.[42]Stalin also launched an attack on Finland, which he hoped to reduce to little more than a Soviet puppet state, but theRed Armymet staunch Finnish resistance in what became known as theWinter Warand succeeded in gaining only limited territory from the Finns.[43]This action would later cause the Finns to ally with Germany when its attack on the Soviet Union came in 1941.[44]

After the defeat of Poland, a period known as thePhony Warensued during the winter of 1939–1940, which saw only limited military land operation on theWestern Front.[45]This changed when Hitler occupied Denmark and Norway, beginning on 9 April 1940. Norway was strategically important because of its sea routes which supplied crucial Swedishoreto the Nazi war machine. Norway held on for a few crucial weeks, but Denmark surrendered afteronly six hours.[46][47]Sweden was the only Scandinavian country to successfully maintain its neutrality throughout the war, with occasional breaches of neutrality in favor of bothGermanyand theWestern Allies.[48]On 10 May 1940, when the Germans launched a massive attack on theLow Countries(Belgium, the Netherlands, andLuxembourg), likely to surmount theMaginot Lineof defenses on the Franco-German border.[49]This witnessed the incredible fall ofEben Emael, a Belgian fort considered impregnable and guarded by 600 Belgians, to a force of only 88 Germanparatroopers. The worst of this was that KingLeopold III of Belgiumsurrendered to the Germans on 28 May without warning his allies, exposing the entire flank of the Allied forces to German panzer groups.[50]

With the disaster in the Low Countries, France, considered at the time to have had the finest army in the world, lasted only six weeks, with Paris being occupied on 14 June. Three days later, MarshalPhilippe Pétainsurrendered to the Germans.[51]The debacle in France also led to one of the war's greatest mysteries, and Hitler's first great blunder,Dunkirk, where a third of a million trapped British and French soldiers were evacuated by not only British war boats, but every craft the army could find, including fishing boats. Hitler refused to "risk" his panzers on an action at Dunkirk, listening to the advice of Air MinisterHermann Göringand allowing theLuftwaffe, or German Air Force, to handle the job.[52]The irony of this was that the escaped men would form the core of the army that was to invade the beaches ofNormandyin 1944. Hitler did not occupy all of France, but about three-quarters, including all of the Atlantic coast, allowing Marshal Pétain to remain as dictator of an area known asVichy France.[53]However, members of the escaped French Army formed around GeneralCharles de Gaulleto create theFree Frenchforces, which would continue to battle Hitler in the stead of an independent France.[54]At this moment, Italy, underBenito Mussolini, declared war on the Allies on 10 June, thinking that the war was almost over, but he managed only to occupy a few hundred yards of French territory.[55]Throughout the war, the Italians would be more of a burden to the Nazis than a boon, and would later cost them precious time in Greece.[56][57]

Hitler now turned his eyes on Great Britain, which stood alone against him. He ordered his generals to draw up plans for an invasion, code namedOperation Sea Lion, and ordered the Luftwaffe to launch a massive air war against the British isles, which would come to be known as theBattle of Britain. The British at first suffered steady losses, but eventually managed to turn the air war against Germany, taking down 2,698 German planes throughout the summer of 1940 to only 915Royal Air Force(RAF) losses.[58]The key turning point came when the Germans discontinued successful attacks against British airplane factories and radar command and coordination stations and turned to civilian bombing known asterror bombingusing the distinctive "bomb" sound created by the German dive-bomber, theStuka.[59]The switch came after a small British bombing force had attacked Berlin.[60]Hitler was infuriated. However, his decision to switch the attacks' focus allowed the British to rebuild the RAF and eventually force the Germans to indefinitely postpone Sea Lion.[61]

The importance of the Battle of Britain is that it marked the first of Hitler's defeats, however its overall impact was overshadowed by his later blunders in the east. Secondly, it marked the advent ofradaras a major weapon in modern air war.  With radar, squadrons of fighters could be quickly assembled to respond to incoming bombers attempting to bomb civilian targets. It also allowed the identification of the type and a guess at the number of incoming enemy aircraft, as well as tracking of friendly airplanes.[62]

Hitler, taken aback by his defeat over the skies of Britain, now turned his gaze eastward to theSoviet Union. Despite having signed the non-aggression pact with Stalin, Hitler despised communism and wished to destroy it in the land of its birth. He originally planned to launch the attack in early spring of 1941 to avoid the disastrous Russian winter. However, a pro-allied coup inYugoslaviaand Mussolini's almost utter defeat in his invasion of Greece from occupiedAlbaniaprompted Hitler to launch a personal campaign of revenge in Yugoslavia and to occupy Greece at the same time.[63]The Greeks would have a bitter revenge of sorts; the attack caused a delay of several crucial weeks of the invasion of the USSR, potentially hampering it.[64]

On 22 June 1941,Hitler attacked Stalin with the largest army the world had ever seen. Over three million men and their weapons were put into service against the Soviet Union.[65]Stalin had been warned about the attack, both by other countries and by his own intelligence network, but he had refused to believe it. Therefore, the Soviet army was largely unprepared and suffered massive setbacks in the early part of the war, despite Stalin's orders to counterattack the Germans.[66]Throughout 1941, German forces, divided into 3 army groups (Army Group A, Army Group B, and Army Group C), occupied the territories of the present dayUkraineandBelarus, laid siege toLeningrad(present day Saint Petersburg), and advanced to within 15 miles of Moscow. At this critical moment, the Soviet people stalled the GermanWehrmachtto a halt at the gates of Moscow. Stalin had planned to evacuate the city, and had already moved important government functions, but decided to stay and rally the city. Recently arrived troops from the east under the command of MarshalGeorgy Zhukovcounterattacked the Germans and drove them from Moscow.[67]

Mussolini had launched an offensive in North Africa from Italian-controlledLibyainto British-controlled Egypt. However, the British smashed the Italians and were on the verge of taking Libya. Hitler decided to help by sending in a few thousand troops, aLuftwaffedivision, and the first-rate generalErwin Rommel.[68]Rommel managed to use his small force to repeatedly smash massively superior British forces and to recapture the port city ofTobrukand advance intoEgypt. However, Hitler, embroiled in his invasion of the Soviet Union, refused to send Rommel any more troops, causing Rommel to retreat and preventing him from seizing theMiddle East, where Axis-friendly regimes had taken root inIraqandPersia(present-dayIran).[69][70]

After the winter, Hitler launched a fresh offensive in the spring of 1942, with the aim of capturing the oil-rich Caucacus and the city ofStalingrad. However, he repeatedly switched his troops to where they were not needed. The offensive bogged down, and the entire6th Army, considered the best of German troops, was trapped in Stalingrad. Hitler now refused to let 6th Army break out. He insisted that the German army would force its way in. Hermann Göring also assured Hitler that theLuftwaffecould supply the 6th Army adequately, when it could in reality only supply a minute fraction of the neededammunitionandrations. Eventually, the starved 6th Army surrendered, dealing a severe blow to the Germans. In the end, the defeat at Stalingrad was the turning point for the war in the east.[71]

Meanwhile, the Japanese had attacked the United States atPearl Harborin Hawaii on 7 December 1941. This disastrous attack forced the Americans into the war. Parts of the German brass advised against declaring war on the US, arguing that since Japan was the aggressor, theTripartite Pactdidn't bind Germany to do so. However, Hitler hoped that Japan would be able to quickly defeat the US and then turn its attention on helping the effort against Russia. Both Germany and Italy declared war on the United States a few days after the attack.[72]

Throughout the rest of 1942 and 1943, the Soviets began to gain ground against the Germans after some victories like the tank battle ofKursk.[73]By this time, Rommel had been forced to abandon North Africa after a defeat byMontgomeryatEl Alameinin what was the first decisive victory of the Allies over the Germany army, leading Churchill to declare it "the end of the beginning".[74]On several fronts, theWehrmachthad encountered serious casualties that it could not replace. Hitler also insisted on a "hold at all costs" policy which forbade relinquishing any ground. He followed a "fight to the last man" policy that was completely ineffective. By the beginning of 1944, Hitler had lost all initiative in the Soviet Union, and was struggling even to hold back the tide turning against him.[75]

From 1942 to 1944, the United States and Britain acted in only a limited manner in the European theater, much to the chagrin of Stalin. They drove out the Germans in Africa, invadingMoroccoandAlgeriaon 8 November 1942.[76]Then, on 10 July 1943, the Allies invadedSicily, in preparation for an advance through Italy, the "soft underbelly" of the Axis, asWinston Churchillcalled it. On 9 September, the invasion of Italy began.[77]By the winter of 1943, the southern half of Italy was in Allied hands. The Italians, most of whom did not really support the war, had already turned against Mussolini. In July, he had been stripped of power and taken prisoner, though the Italians feigned continued support of the Axis. On 8 September, the Italians formally surrendered,[78]but most of Italy not in Allied hands was controlled by German troops and those loyal to Mussolini's (Mussolini had been freed by German paratroopers) newItalian Social Republic, which in reality consisted of the shrinking zone of German control. The Germans offered staunch resistance, but by 4 June 1944, Rome had fallen.[79]

TheBattle of the Atlantictook place from 1942 to 1944 and was described as "longest, largest, and most complex naval battle in history".[80]The Germans hoped to sever the vital supply lines between Britain and America, sinking many tons of shipping withU-boats, German submarines. However, the development of thedestroyerand aircraft with a longer patrol range were effective at countering the U-boat threat and by December 1943, the Germans had lost the battle.[81]

On 6 June 1944, the Western Allies finally launched the long-awaited assault on "Fortress Europe" so wanted by Stalin. The offensive, codenamedOperation Overlord, began the early morning hours of 6 June. The day, known asD-Day, was marked by foul weather.  Rommel, who was now in charge of defending France against possible Allied attack, thought the Allies would not attack during the stormy weather, and was on holiday in Germany.[82]Besides this, the Germans were expecting an attack, but at the natural harbor ofCalaisand not the beaches ofNormandy; They did not know about the Allies'artificial harbours, and false leads planted by the Allies suggested Calais as the landing site.[83]

By this time, the war was looking ever darker for Germany. On 20 July 1944, a group of conspiring German officers attempted to assassinate Hitler. The bomb they used did injure him, but the second was not used, and a table shielded Hitler in a stroke of luck.[84]The plotters still could have launched a coup, but only the head of occupied Paris acted, arrestingSSandGestapoforces in the city. The German propaganda minister,Joseph Goebbels, rallied the Nazis and hunted down the conspirators, arresting up to 7000 people in the wake of the plot, according to some estimates.[85]

In France, the Allies took Normandy and finally Paris on 25 August.[86]In the east, the Soviets had advanced almost to the former Polish-Soviet border. At this time, Hitler introduced theV-weapons, theV-1 flying bomband, later, theV-2, the first rockets used in modern warfare. The V-1 was often intercepted by air pilots, but the V-2 was extremely fast and carried a large payload. However, this advance came too late in the war to have any real effect.[87]The Germans were also on the verge of introducing a number of terrifying new weapons, including advanced jet aircraft, which were too fast for ordinary propeller aircraft, and submarine improvements which would allow the Germans to again fight effectively in the Atlantic. All this came too late to save Hitler. Although a September invasion of The Netherlands failed, the Allies made steady advances. In the winter of 1944, Hitler put everything into one last desperate gamble in the West, known as theBattle of the Bulge, which, despite an initial advance, was a failure, because the introduction of new Allied tanks and low troop numbers among the Germans prevented any real action being taken. Nevertheless, it was one of the bloodiest battles of the war andthe second costliest battle in the history of the American Army.[88]

In early February 1945, the three Allied leaders,Franklin Roosevelt,Winston Churchill, andJoseph Stalin, met at newly liberatedYaltain theCrimeain the Soviet Union in theYalta Conference.[89]Here, they agreed upon a plan to divide post-war Europe. Most of the east went to Stalin, who agreed to allow free elections in Eastern Europe, which he never did. The west went to Britain, France, and the U.S. Post-war Germany would be split between the four, as would Berlin. This division of spheres of influence would set up international diplomacy for theCold Warthat would dominate the second half of the century.[90]

At the beginning of 1945, Hitler was on his last strings. The Soviets launched a devastating attack from Poland into Germany and Eastern Europe, intending to take Berlin. The Germans collapsed in the West, allowing the Allies to fan out across Germany. However, the Supreme Allied Commander, American generalDwight D. Eisenhower, refused to strike for Berlin, and instead became obsessed with reports of possible guerrilla activity in southern Germany, which in reality existed mainly in the propaganda of Joseph Goebbels.[91]By 25 April the Soviets had besieged Berlin. Hitler remained in the city in a bunker under theChancellerygarden. On 30 April he committed suicide by shooting himself, after a ritual wedding with his longtime mistressEva Braun.[92]The Germans held out another 7 days underAdmiral Doenitz, their new leader, but the Germans surrendered unconditionally on 7 May 1945, ending the war in Europe (seeV-E Day).[93]

Rivalries that had begun during the war, combined with the sense of strength in the victorious powers, laid the foundations of theIron Curtainand of the Cold War.

The first event that is usually linked to the later Pacific conflict was theMukden Incidentof 18 September 1931, during which the Japanese military staged the bombing of theSouth Manchuria Railwayand pinned the blame on Chinese dissidents.[94]Japan then used this aspretexttoinvade northeastern Chinathe next day and turn the region ofManchuriainto the Japanesepuppet stateofManchukuo.[95]After the League of Nations commissioned the 1932Lytton Report, which exposed the Mukden Incident as a Japanese ruse, Japan was left internationally isolated, withdrawing from the League of Nations in March 1933. In 1934 Manchukuo became a constitutional monarchy and the former Chinese EmperorPu Yiwas placed on the throne, despite the real power being held by Japan.[96]

Despite relations between Japan and China suffering because the occupation of Manchuria, the situation did not turn into all-out war until 7 July 1937, when a dispute between Chinese and Japanese soldiers turned into a battle during theMarco Polo Bridge Incident.[97]This, in turn, led to a further escalation of the hostilities, leading to theSecond Sino-Japanese War, one of the deadliest conflicts in human history.[98]Japan enjoyed some early major victories, capturing bothShanghaiand the Chinese capital ofNanjingin 1937 and forcing the Chinese central government 's relocation toChongqing. Following Chinese victories inChangshaandGuangxiin 1939, the war reached somewhat of a stalemate, with Japan controlling the large cities, but being unable to rule the vast countryside.[99]On 27 September 1940, Japan became cosignatories of theTripartite Pact, joining a military alliance with Germany and Italy.[100]

On 7 December 1941, Japan launched a surprise attack on the American base atPearl Harboras a mean of preventing theU.S. Pacific Fleetfrom interfering with its planned expansion in the area.[101]The next day, following Roosevelt'sInfamy Speech, the United States declared war on Japan, marking the official entry of both nations in World War 2.[102][103]At the same time, Japan also launched attacks onThailand, the British colonies ofMalaya,Singapore,Hong Kongand American military bases inGuam,Wake Islandandthe Philippines.[104]

The next six months were dominated by Japanese victories against the Allied forces, already war-weary and stretched thin after two years of war in Europe and North Africa. Japan managed to captureBritish Burma,New Guinea, theDutch East Indies, theSolomon Islands,BaliandTimor.[105]In March 1942, days before the surrender of the Philippines, general Douglas MacArthur, who came out of retirement to become commander ofUnited States Army Forces in the Far Eastat the onset of the war,was forced to flee and narrowly escapeto Australia.[106]On 19 February 1942, Japan also launched a devastating aerial attack on the Australian city of Darwin, in what was the first attack by a foreign power on Australian soil.[107]

The turning of the tide came in early May, during theBattle of the Coral Sea, which proved the first strategic victory of the Allies against Japanese expansion.[108]This was followed one month later by theBattle of Midway, in which theUS Navydefeated an attacking Japanese fleet, inflicting devastating damage on the attacking force. The Battle of Midway is widely considered the most important naval battle of the Pacific Campaign and has even been described as "the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare"[109]The reasons usually given for the resounding victory are Japanese overconfidence in their own forces, poor planning and the intercepting of Japanese battle plans by the United States.[110]The losses suffered during this Battle of Midway, paired with the campaign of attrition that was taking place inSolomon Islands, left Japan unable to replenish its forces and turned the tides of war against it. By August 1942, the Allied forces were on the offensive, earning victories in theNew Guinea campaignatGuadalcanal,Milne BayandBuna-Gona.[111]

Over the next two years the Allies slowly captured one island base after another, trying to get closer to Japan itself, where it planned to launch massive strategic air attacks and, only if absolutely necessary, execute a ground invasion. By July 1944, the USrecaptured Guamandcaptured Tinian, which finally put them in attacking range of mainland Japan using the newBoeing B-29bombers.[112]Despite the advances of the Allies, massive fighting was still taking place, both inSouth-East Asiawith theJapanese offensive in Indiaand in the Pacific, with theBattle of the Philippine Sea, where Japan suffered major losses and definitively lost the ability to rely onaircraft carriers.[113]In later October, a combined attack of American and Australian forces took on the Imperial Japanese Navy during theBattle of Leyte Gulfin what was to be the largest naval battle of World War II and possibly thelargest naval battle of all time.[114]The Allied victory achieved its stated goal of further severing oil supplied to the Japanese army, which was already struggling to fuel the remainder of its naval power.[115]The battle of Leyte Gulf is also notable as the first battle in which Japanese aircraft carried out organizedkamikazeattacks.[116]

By early 1945, the Americans set their eyes on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima, which was of great strategic importance, being situated halfway betweenTokyoand theMariana Islands. Capturing the island meant not only a better launch station for aerial attacks against mainland Japan, but also the prevention of its use as an early-warning station against air raids. The Japanese were expecting an attack and have been heavily fortifying the entire island for over a year.[117]Despite the American troops outnumbering the Japanese to a rate of more than 3 to 1, the USA suffered heavy casualties in the 36 days of fighting, with over 6,800 Marines killed and another 20,000 wounded,[118]leading some historians to question the strategic worth of the action.[119]With Japan struggling to defend the homeland islands, counteroffensives in other parts of the Japanese Empire became more feasible, with important battles taking place inBurma,BorneoandChina.

Continuing to come nearer the main Japanese islands, on 1 April 1945 the US Marines mounted the largestamphibious assaultof the Pacific Theater on the island ofOkinawa.[120]After a long campaign ofisland hopping, the Allies were planning to useKadena Air Baseon the large island of Okinawa as a base forOperation Downfall, the planned invasion of theJapanese home islandswhich were only 340 miles away.[121]The battle was one of the bloodiest in the Pacific, with approximately 160,000 casualties on both sides: at least 75,000 Allied and 84,166–117,000 Japanese. Around half of the island's population of 300,000 were killed, committed suicide or went missing.[122]

The assaults on both Iwo Jima and Okinawa proved incredibly costly in terms of American lives and president Truman was horrified at the prospect of Operation Downfall, a planned boots-on-the-ground invasion of mainland Japan that was estimated to lead to over a million casualties among American soldiers.[123]Despite a devastating campaign of fire-bombing in Tokyo and dozens of other cities, the Japanese showed no sign of planning to surrender. Following thePotsdam Declarationof 26 July, where the Allies threatened "prompt and utter destruction" should Japan not surrender,[124]the decision was made to resort to the first use ofatomic bombs. On 6 August, the 393d Bombardment Squadron B-29Enola Gay, took off from Tinian and dropped the bomb on the city of Hiroshima. Three days later, a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. The two bombings killed 129,000–226,000 people, most of them civilians.[125]On 9 August, the Soviet Union also invaded Manchukuo in what was to be the last campaign of the war.[126]

On 10 August the "sacred decision" was made by Japanese Cabinet to accept thePotsdam termsand on 15 AugustEmperor Hirohitobroadcast to the nation and to the world at large the rescript of surrender, ending the Second World War.[127]The formalJapanese Instrument of Surrenderwas signed on 2 September 1945, on the battleshipUSSMissouri, inTokyo Bay. The surrender was accepted by General Douglas MacArthur asSupreme Commander of the Allied Powers.[128]

The Holocaust (which roughly means "great fire") was the deliberate, systematic murder of millions of Jews and other minorities during World War II byHitler's Nazi regimein Europe. Several differing views exist regarding whether it was intended to occur from the war's beginning, or if the plans for it came about later.[129][130]Regardless, persecution of Jews extended well before the war even started, such as in theKristallnacht(literally "Crystal Night", Night of Broken Glass).[131]The Nazisused propaganda to great effect to stir up antisemitic feelings within ordinary Germans. Many people, including politicians and historians, consider the Holocaust to be the worst event in history, and have described Hitler,his followers, andhis regimeasevil.

After the conquest of Poland, theThird Reich, which had previously deported Jews and other "undesirables", suddenly had within its borders the largest concentration of Jews in the world. The solution was to round up Jews and place them inNazi concentration campsor inghettos, cordoned off sections of cities where Jews were forced to live in deplorable conditions, often with tens of thousands starving to death, and the bodies decaying in the streets.[132][133]As appalling as this sounds, they were the lucky ones. After the invasion of the Soviet Union, armed killing squads ofSSmen known asEinsatzgruppensystematically rounded up Jews and murdered an estimated one million Jews within the country.[134]As barbaric and inhuman as this seems, it was too slow and inefficient by Nazi standards.

In 1942, the top leadership met inWannsee, a suburb of Berlin, and began to plan a more efficient way to slaughter the Jews.[135]The Nazis created a system ofextermination campsthroughout Poland, and began rounding up Jews from the Soviet Union, and from the Ghettos.[136][137]Not only were Jews shot or gassed to death en masse, but they were forced to provide slave labor and they were used in horrific medical experiments (seeHuman experimentation in Nazi Germany).[138]Out of the widespread condemnation of the Nazis' medical experiments, theNuremberg Codeof medical ethics was devised.[139]

The Nazis took a sadistic pleasure in the death camps; the entrance to the most notorious camp,Auschwitz, stated"Arbeit Macht Frei"—"Work Sets You Free".[140]In the end, six million Jews and up to 5 million homosexuals,Jehovah's Witnesses,Romaand political prisoners were killed by various means, mainly in the death camps.[141][142][143]An additional several million Soviet and other Allied prisoners of war died in camps and holding areas.[144][145]

There is some controversy over whether ordinary Germans knew about the Holocaust.[146]It appears that many Germans knew about the concentration camps; such things were prominently displayed in magazines and newspapers.[147]In many places, Jews had to walk past towns and villages on their way to work as slaves in German industry. In any case, Allied soldiers reported that the smell of the camps carried for miles.[148]A very small number of peopledeny the Holocaust occurredentirely, though these claims have been routinely discredited by mainstream historians.[149]

During the 1930s, innovations inphysicsmade it apparent that it could be possible to developnuclear weaponsof incredible power usingnuclear reactions.[150]When World War II broke out, scientists and advisors among the Allies feared that Nazi Germany may have been trying to develop its own atomic weapons, and the United States and the United Kingdom pooled their efforts in what became known as theManhattan Projectto beat them to it. At the secretLos Alamos laboratoryinNew Mexico, scientistRobert Oppenheimerled a team of the world's top scientists to develop the first nuclear weapons, the first of which was tested at theTrinity sitein July 1945.[151]However, Germany had surrendered in May 1945, and it had been discovered that theGerman atomic bomb programhad not been very close to success.[152]

The Allied team produced two nuclear weapons for use in the war, one powered byuranium-235and the other byplutoniumasfissionablematerial, named "Little Boy" and "Fat Man".[153]These were dropped on the Japanese cities ofHiroshimaandNagasakion 6 and 9 August 1945 each. This, in combination with the Soviet invasion of Japanese-controlled territory, convinced the Japanese government to surrender unconditionally. These two weapons remain the only two nuclear weapons ever used against other countries in war.[154]

Nuclear weapons brought an entirely new andterrifying possibilitytowarfareofnuclear annihilation, because it was feared that they would bring about thehuman extinctionovernight. While at first the United States held a monopoly on the production of nuclear weapons, the Soviet Union, with some assistance from espionage, managed to detonate its first weapon (dubbed "Joe-1" by the West) in August 1949.[155][156]The post-war relations between the two, which had already been deteriorating, began to rapidly disintegrate. Soon the two were locked in a massive stockpiling of nuclear weapons. The United States began a crash program to develop the firsthydrogen bombin 1950, and detonated its firstthermonuclearweapon in 1952. This new weapon was alone over 400 times as powerful as the weapons used against Japan. The Soviet Union detonated a primitive thermonuclear weapon in 1953 and a full-fledged one in 1955.[157]

The conflict continued to escalate, with the major superpowers developing long-range missiles (such as theICBM) and anuclear strategywhich guaranteed that any use of the nuclear weapons would be suicide for the attacking nation (Mutually Assured Destruction). The creation ofearly warning systemsput the control of these weapons into the hands of newly created computers, and they served as a tense backdrop throughout theCold War.[158]

Since the 1940s there were concerns about the risingproliferation of nuclear weaponsto new countries, which was seen as being destabilizing to international relations, spurring regionalarms races, and generally increasing the likelihood of some form ofnuclear war. Eventually, nine nations would overtly develop nuclear weapons, and still maintain stockpiles today: theUnited States, theSoviet Union(and later Russia would inherit these), theUnited Kingdom,France,China,India,Pakistan,IsraelandNorth Korea.[159]South Africadeveloped six crude weapons in the 1980s (which it later dismantled),[160]andIsraelalmost certainly developed nuclear weapons though it never confirmed nor denied it.[161]The creation of theNuclear Non-proliferation Treatyin 1968 was an attempt to curtail such proliferation,[162]but a number of countries developed nuclear weapons since it was signed (and many did not sign it), and several other countries, includingLibyaandIranwere suspected of having clandestine nuclear weapons programs.[163][164]

Following World War II, the majority of the industrialized world lay in ruins as a result of aerial bombings, naval bombardment, and protracted land campaigns. The United States was a notable exception to this; barringPearl Harborand some minor incidents, the U.S. had suffered no attacks upon its territory.[165]The United States and theSoviet Union, which, despite the devastation of its most populated areas, rebuilt quickly, found themselves the world's two dominant superpowers.[166]

Much of Western Europe was rebuilt after the war with assistance from theMarshall Plan. Germany, chief instigator of the war, was placed under joint militaryoccupationby the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Berlin, although in Soviet-controlled territory, was also divided among the four powers.[167]Occupation of Berlin would continue until 1990. Japan was also placed under U.S. occupation, that would last seven years, until 1952.[168]Oddly, these twoAxispowers, despite military occupation, soon rose to become the second (Japan) and third (West Germany) most powerful economies in the world.[169]

Following the end of the war, theAlliesfamously prosecuted numerous German officials forwar crimesand other offenses in theNuremberg Trials. AlthoughAdolf Hitlerhad committed suicide, many of his cronies, includingHermann Göring, were convicted. Less well-known trials of otherAxisofficials also occurred, including theTokyo War Crime Trial.[170]

The failure of theLeague of Nationsto prevent World War II essentially discredited the organization, and it was dissolved.[171]A new attempt atworld peacewas begun with the founding of the United Nations on 24 October 1945, in San Francisco.[172]Today, nearly all countries are members, but despite its many successes, the organization's success at achieving its goal of world peace is disputed. The organization was never given enough power to overcome the conflicting interests and priorities of its member nations.

Almost all the major nations involved in World War II began shedding their overseas colonies soon after the conflict. The tactics employed by the revolutionaries ranged fromnon-violentforms of protest to armed rebellions, depending on the nation involved.[173][174]Immediately after the war, European powers began a decades-long process of withdrawing from their possessions in Africa and Asia.

In India,Mahatma Gandhibecame a global icon for his non-violent struggle to achieveIndian independencewhereasMohamed Ali Jinnahadvocated for the independence of a separate state for Muslims. This was achieved in 1947 with the end of British rule in India and thePartitionof the territory into modern-day India andPakistan, which would later also further divide, leading to the creation of thePeople's Republic of Bangladeshin 1971.[175][176]Elsewhere in Asia, The United States granted independence to thePhilippines, its major Pacific possession in 1946.[177]InFrench Indochina, armed insurrections forced the French out in the early 1950s, leading to the formation ofLaos,CambodiaandVietnam.[178]

In Africa, nationalists such asJomo KenyattaofKenyaandKwame NkrumahofGhanaled their respective nations to independence from foreign rule.[179]Mere decades before, the British Empire controlled almost half of the continent, but by 1968, the only British possession in Africa was Seychelles (which would also become independent in 1976). Between 1956 and 1962, almost 20 African countries achieved their independence from France.[180]Through the efforts ofAmílcar Cabraland others, the Portuguese colonies ofGuinea-Bissau,Cape Verde,Angola,MozambiqueandSão Tomé and Príncipefollowed suit and achieved independence during the mid-1970s, in what was to be the last important wave of African decolonization.[181]

In 1946, there were 35 member states in the United Nations, but as the newly independent nations joined the organization, by 1970 membership increased to 127.[182]

The emergence of newly independent countries in Africa and Asia that used the borders of the imperial partitions later led to further conflict.[183]In many cases this meant that historically antagonistic ethnic or religious groups now needed to share the same country or that several nations held territorial claims over regions which were more or less arbitrarily divided by European powers.[184][185]Some conflicts which aroused from these tensions, especially theNigerian Civil War, theSecond Congo War, theSecond Sudanese Civil Warand theBangladesh Liberation Warhave been among the bloodiest wars of the 20th century.[186]

During the Yalta Conference, where the Western,capitalistpowers, and thecommunistSoviet Union agreed on separate spheres of influence in Europe, they set up the stage for a geopolitical rivalry that would dominate international relations for the next five decades.[187]In March 1946, Winston Churchill gave a now famous speech while visitingWestminster Collegein the US which is usually credited as the first use of the termIron Curtainto refer to the separation of Soviet and Western areas of influence in Europe:[188]

FromStettinin theBaltictoTriestein theAdriatican iron curtain has descended across the Continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia; all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject, in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and in some cases increasing measure of control from Moscow.

Indeed, the Soviet Union had already annexed several countries asSoviet Socialist Republicsduring the war. EasternPoland(incorporatedinto theByelorussian SSRand theUkrainian SSR),[189]Latvia(which became theLatvian SSR),Estonia(which became theEstonian SSR),Lithuania( which became theLithuanian SSR),[190]part of easternFinland(which became theKarelo-Finnish SSR)[191]and easternRomania(part of which became theMoldavian SSR)[192]were now wholly part of Soviet Union. Furthermore, between 1945 and 1949,Yugoslavia,Albania,Bulgaria,Poland,Romania,Czechoslovakia,HungaryandEast Germanysaw communist regimes coming to power and their transformation intoPeople's Republics.[193]While they remained independent countries and their relation with the Soviet authorities would fluctuate over the next half century, they were widely seen as Sovietsatellite states. Outside of Europe, countries that would see the rise of communism and would ally themselves to the communist bloc includeMongolia, China,North Korea,CubaandVietnam.[194]

The spread of the communist ideology in general and the Soviet influence in particular made Western leaders nervous and it even lead to Churchill considering a preemptive attack on the USSR even before World War II was formally ended.[195]

The two rival blocks also coalesced into formal mutual defense organizations, with the formation of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)in 1949[196]and theWarsaw Pactin 1955,[197]each determine to expand its own influence amongunaligned countriesand limit the influence of their rivals.

Two wars and a near-war in the 1950s became the focus for capitalist versus communist struggle. The first war was theKorean War, fought between People's Republic of China-backedNorth Koreaand mainly United States-backedSouth Korea. The Korean Peninsula was a Japanese colony between 1910 and 1945, when Soviet and American troops invaded and divided it along the38th parallel.[198]A communist government controlled the territory north of the border and a capitalist one controlled the South, with both authorities considering the other one illegitimate and claiming sovereignty over the entire peninsula.[199]North Korea's invasion of South Korea on 25 June 1950 led to United Nations intervention.[200]GeneralDouglas MacArthurled troops from the United States, Canada, Australia, Great Britain, and other countries in repulsing the Northern invasion. However, the war reached a stalemate after Chinese intervention pushed U.N. forces back, and anArmisticeended hostilities in July 1953, leaving the two Koreas divided and tense for the rest of the century.[201]

The second war, theVietnam War, was perhaps the third most visible war of the 20th century, after World War I and World War II. After theFrench withdrawalfrom its former colony, on 21 July 1954, Vietnam became partitioned into two halves, much like Korea, along the17th parallel. Fighting between North and South eventually escalated into a regional war. The United States provided aid to South Vietnam[202]and contributed to propaganda efforts against the North,[203]but was not directly involved until theGulf of Tonkin Resolution, passed in reaction to a supposed North Vietnamese attack upon Americandestroyers, brought the U.S. into the war as a belligerent.[204]The war was initially viewed as a fight to contain communism (seecontainment,Truman Doctrine, andDomino Theory), but, as more Americans weredraftedand news of events such as theTet OffensiveandMy Lai massacreleaked out, American sentiment turned against the war.[205][206]U.S. PresidentRichard Nixonwas elected partially on a promise to end the war. ThisNixon Doctrineinvolved a gradual pullout of American forces; South Vietnamese units were supposed to replace them, backed up by American air power. The plan went awry, with Nixon  deliberately sabotaging peace talks for political gain,[207]and the war spilled into neighboringCambodiawhile South Vietnamese forces were pushed further back.[208]Eventually, the U.S. and North Vietnam signed theParis Peace Accords, ending U.S. involvement in the war.[209]With the threat of U.S. retaliation gone, the North proceeded to violate the ceasefire and invaded the South with full military force.Saigonwas captured on 30 April 1975, and Vietnam was unified under Communist rule a year later, effectively bringing an end to one of the most unpopular wars of all time.[210][211]

TheCuban Missile Crisisillustrates just how close to the brink ofnuclear warthe world came during theCold War.Cuba, underFidel Castro's socialist government, had formed close ties with theSoviet Union.[212]This was obviously disquieting to the United States, given Cuba's proximity. WhenLockheed U-2spy plane flights over the island revealed that Soviet missile launchers were being installed,U.S. PresidentJohn F. Kennedyinstituted a navalblockadeand publicly confronted the Soviet Union. After a tense week, the Soviet Union backed down and ordered the launchers removed, not wanting to risk igniting a new world war.[213][214]

WithCold Wartensions running high, theSoviet Unionand United States took their rivalry to the stars in 1957 with the Soviet launch ofSputnik.[215]A "space race" between the two powers followed.[216]The USSR reached several important milestones, such as the first craft on theMoon(Luna 2)[217]the first human in space (Yuri Gagarin).,[218]and the firstspacewalk(Alexey LeonovonVoskhod 2).[219]The U.S. pulled ahead eventually with itsMercury,Gemini, andApolloprograms, which culminated inApollo 11astronauts landing on the Moon on 20 July 1969.[220]Five more landings with astronauts followed (Apollo 13was forced to abort its mission).[221]Nevertheless, despite its successes, the U.S. space program could not match many major achievements of the Soviet space program, such asrover-based space explorationandimage and video transferfrom the surface of another planet, until the early 21st century.[222][223]

In addition, both countries launched numerousprobesinto space, such as theVenera 7andVoyager 2.[224]

In later decades, space became a somewhat friendlier place. Regular space flights with astronauts were made possible with the AmericanSpace Shuttle, which was the first reusable spacecraft to be successfully used.[225]MirandSkylabenabled prolonged human habitation in space.[226][227]In the 1990s, work on theInternational Space Stationbegan, and by the end of the century, while still incomplete, it was in continual use by astronauts from the United States, Europe, Russia, Japan, and Canada.[228]

By the 1980s, theSoviet Unionwas weakening. TheSino-Soviet splithad removed the USSR's most powerful ally, the People's Republic of China.[229]Itsarms racewith the U.S. was draining the country of funds, and further weakened by internal pressures, ethnic and political.Mikhail Gorbachev, its last leader, attempted to reform the country withglasnostandperestroika,[230]but the formation ofSolidarity,[231]the fall of theBerlin Wall,[232]and the breaking-off of several Soviet republics, such asLithuania,[233]started a slippery slope of events that culminated in a coup to overthrow Gorbachev, organized by Communist Party hard-liners.Boris Yeltsin, president of Russia, organized mass opposition, and the coup failed.[234]On 26 December 1991, the Soviet Union was officially disbanded into its constituent republics, thus putting a final line under the already exhaustedCold War.[235]

The creation of thetransistorrevolutionized the development of the computer. The first computers, room-sized electro-mechanical devices built to breakcryptographicalcodes during World War II,[236]quickly became at least 20 times smaller using transistors.[237]Computers becamereprogrammablerather than fixed-purpose devices. The invention ofprogramming languagesmeant computer operators could concentrate on problem solving at a high-level, without having to think in terms of the individual instructions to the computer itself.[238]The creation ofoperating systemsalso vastly improvedprogramming productivity. Building on this, computer pioneers could now realize what they had envisioned. Thegraphical user interface, piloted by acomputer mousemade it simple to harness the power of the computer and made it more accessible to new users.[239]Storagefor computer programs progressed frompunched cardsandpaper tapetomagnetic tape,floppy disksandhard disks.Core memoryandbubble memoryfell torandom access memory.[240]

The invention of theword processor,spreadsheetanddatabasegreatly improved office productivity over the old paper,typewriterand filing cabinet methods.[241][242]The economic advantage given to businesses led to economic efficiencies in computers themselves. Cost-effectiveCPUsled to thousands of industrial and home-brew computer designs, many of which became successful; a home-computer boom was led by theApple II, theZX80and theCommodore PET.[243][244]IBM, seeking to embrace themicrocomputer revolution, devised itsIBM Personal Computer(PC). Crucially, IBM developed the PC from third-party components that were available on the open market.[245]The only impediment to another company duplicating the system's architecture was the proprietaryBIOSsoftware. Other companies, starting withCompaq,reverse engineeredthe BIOS and releasedPC compatiblecomputers that soon became the dominant architecture.[246][247]Microsoft, which produced an operating system for the PC, rode this wave of popularity to become the world's leading software company.[248]

The 1980s heralded theInformation Age. The rise of computer applications anddata processingmade ethereal "information" as valuable as physical commodities. This brought about new concerns surrounding intellectual property issues. The U.S. Government made algorithms patentable, forming the basis ofsoftware patents.[249]The controversy over these andproprietary softwareledRichard Stallmanto create theFree Software Foundationand begin theGNU Project, paving the way for afree software movement.[250]

Computers also became a usable platform for entertainment. Computer games were first developed by software programmers exercising their creativity on large systems at universities, but these efforts became commercially successful inarcade gamessuch asPongandSpace Invaders.[251]Once the home computer market was established, young programmers in their bedrooms became the core of a youthfulvideo game industry.[252]In order to take advantage of advancing technology,games consoleswere created. Like arcade systems, these machines had custom hardware designed to do game-oriented operations (such asspritesandparallax scrolling) in preference to general purpose computing tasks.[253]

Computer networksappeared in two main styles; thelocal area network, linking computers in an office or school to each other, and thewide area network, linking the local area networks together. Initially, computers depended on thetelephone networksto link to each other, spawning theBulletin Boardsub-culture.[254]However, aDARPAproject to create bomb-proof computer networks led to the creation of the Internet, a network of networks. The core of this network was the robustTCP/IPnetwork protocol.[255]Thanks to efforts fromAl Gore, the Internet grew beyond its military role when universities and commercial businesses were permitted to connect their networks to it.[256][257]The main impetus for this waselectronic mail, a far faster and convenient form of communication than a conventional letter and memo distribution, and theFile Transfer Protocol(FTP). However, the Internet remained largely unknown to the general public, who were used to Bulletin Boards and services likeCompuserveandAmerica Online. This changed whenTim Berners-Leedevised a simpler form ofVannevar Bush'shypertext, which he dubbed theWorld Wide Web.[258]"The Web" suddenly changed the Internet into a printing press beyond the geographic boundaries of physical countries; it was termed "cyberspace". Anyone with a computer and an Internet connection could write pages in the simpleHTMLformat and publish their thoughts to the world.[259]

The Web's immense success also fueled the commercial use of the Internet. Convenient home shopping had been an element of "visions of the future" since the development of the telephone, but now the race was on to provide convenient, interactive consumerism.[260]Companies trading through websites became known as "dot coms", due to the ".com" suffix of commercial Internet addresses.[261]The change of the century also lead to the fear and paranoia ofY2K, where it was hypothesized that the World's computers would glitch and cause havoc on banks, prisons, transit systems and more.

By the end of the century, more technological advances and scientific discoveries had been made than in all of preceding history. Humansnow had the abilitytocloneorganisms and were able tomapandsequencethe entirehuman genome[262]in the world's largest collaborative biological project.[263]Communications and information technology, transportation technology, and medical advances have radically altered daily lives. Europe appeared to be at a sustainable peace for the first time in recorded history. The people of the Indian subcontinent, a sixth of the world population at the end of the century, had attained indigenous independence for the first time in centuries. China, an ancient nation comprising a fifth of the world's population, was finally open to the world in a new and powerful synthesis of West and East, creating a new state after the near-complete destruction of the old cultural order.  With the end of colonialism and the Cold War, nearly a billion people in Africa were left with truly independent new nation-states, some cut from whole cloth, standing up after centuries of foreign domination.[264]

The world was undergoing its second major period ofglobalization;the first, which started in the 19th century, having been terminated by World War I.[265]Since the US was in a position of almost unchallenged domination, a major part of the process wasAmericanization.[266]This led to anti-Western andanti-Americanfeelings in parts of the world, especially the Middle East.[267]The influence of China and India was also rising, as the world's largest populations, long marginalized by the West and by their rulers, were rapidly integrating with the world economy.[268]

However, several problems face the world. The gap between rich and poor nations continued to widen. Some said that this problem could not be fixed, that there was a set amount of wealth and it could only be shared by so many. Others said that the powerful nations with large economies were not doing enough to help improve the rapidly evolving economies of theThird World. However, developing countries faced many challenges, including the scale of the task to be surmounted, rapidly growing populations, and the need to protect the environment and the cost that goes along with it. Meanwhile, inSouth Africa, the apartheid came to an end andNelson Mandelabecame the nation's first black president, leading to the formation of a new democratic government, after having been ruled for four and a half decades of systemised racial segregation. InRwanda, an estimated one million people were massacred in thegenocide, which included targets ofTutsisand moderateHutuandTwa people.

Terrorism rose in the late century; theOklahoma City bombingkilled 168. Dictatorship and the spread ofnuclear weaponswere other issues requiring attention. The world was still blighted by small-scale wars and other violent conflicts, fueled by competition over resources and ethnic conflicts.Despotssuch asKim Jong-ilofNorth Koreacontinued to lead their nations toward the development of nuclear weapons.[269]

Disease threatened to destabilize many regions of the world. New viruses such asSARSandWest Nilecontinued to spread.[270][271]In poor nations,malariaand other diseases affected the majority of the population. Millions were infected with HIV, the virus which causes AIDS. The virus was becoming anepidemic in southern Africa.[272]Usage ofpenicillinbecame widespread to combat bacterial infections worldwide.

Perhaps most importantly, it was speculated that in the long term, environmental problems threatened the planet's livability. The most serious problem wasglobal warming, which was predicted to frequently flood coastal areas, due to human-caused emission ofgreenhouse gases, particularlycarbon dioxideproduced by the burning offossil fuels. Like the threat of anuclear world war, the shift ofclimate changehas sinceadded to the fearof the possibility ofhuman extinction, although not overnight but over several decades.[273]This prompted many nations to negotiate and sign theKyoto treaty, which set mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions.[274]

Thecelebration of the 20th century’s endingexpressed the popular opinion thatNew Year's Eve1999 andNew Year's Day2000 marked theturn of the millennium, while strictly speaking the 20th century ended on New Year's Eve 2000 and the 21st century began on New Year's Day 2001.
